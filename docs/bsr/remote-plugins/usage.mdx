Protobuf code generation is a challenging process for developers due to the complexities of working with protoc and
plugins. This challenge is compounded as code generation is scaled across multiple developers, with different
languages and runtime requirements for plugins.

To overcome these challenges, organizations and open-source projects often develop their own homegrown Protobuf
tooling to simplify the developer experience and maintain consistent output. However, these solutions are often
difficult to maintain over time, and knowledge of the solutions can be lost as staff leave the organization or project.

To provide a more streamlined approach to code generation, Buf's Remote Plugins remove the need for developers to
manage, download, or run plugins on their local machines. This approach ensures a consistent environment and
provides a necessary solution for the Protobuf ecosystem. Let's take a look at how you can simplify your code
generation workflow with remote packages:

## Configuration

The `buf.gen.yaml` file controls how the `buf generate` command executes
Protobuf plugins for any [input](../../reference/inputs.md). Here, we can
specify [remote plugins](overview.mdx) to perform code generation. For more
information on the `buf.gen.yaml` configuration, see the
[reference](../../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md).

Buf verifies and maintains the commonly-used plugins used across the Protobuf ecosystem. To discover all
publicly available plugins, go to [buf.build/plugins](https://buf.build/plugins).

## 1 Choose your input

Remote plugins generate code for [inputs](../../reference/inputs.md). An input
can be a git repository, tarball, zip file, a or local directory containing
Protobuf files configured with a
[`buf.yaml`](../../configuration/v1/buf-yaml.md) configuration file. Buf refers
to such directories of Protobuf files as [modules](../overview.mdx#modules).

For our purposes, we'll assume you have a `buf.yaml` in your current directory
that defines a module. To create a `buf.yaml` in your current directory.

```terminal
$ buf mod init
```

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1
breaking:
  use:
    - FILE
lint:
  use:
    - DEFAULT
```

See the [build](../../build/usage.md) documentation for full details on how to
configure modules to build with `buf`.

## 2 Create a [`buf.gen.yaml`](/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml)

Now that you have an [input](../../reference/inputs.md) to generate code for, we
need to define a [`buf.gen.yaml`](/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml) and specify
what `protoc` plugins you want to use.

A remote plugin can be pinned to a specific version, or if you want to always
use the latest version of the plugin, the version can be omitted. Here's some
examples for common languages and RPC frameworks:

import GenYaml from "./_gen-yaml.mdx";

<GenYaml/>

Note, we're using the `plugin` key to reference a remote plugin. More
information can be
[found in the buf.gen.yaml docs](/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml#plugin-name-or-remote).

Plugins are invoked in the order they are specified in your `buf.gen.yaml` with
results from each invocation combined before writing the result. For more
information, see the
[`buf.gen.yaml` reference](../../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md).

> As a best practice, when referencing remote, plugins we recommend including
> the version of the plugin to ensure reproducible code generation. It is
> possible to reference both local and remote plugins within a single template
> file.

## 3 Run generate

To generate using the module and `buf.gen.yaml` defined in your current
directory:

```terminal
$ buf generate
```

The `buf generate` command will:

- Send the Protobuf files specified in your input to the Buf Schema Registry
remote plugin executor.
- Invoke each plugin specified in your `buf.gen.yaml`.
- Send the results back, and unpack them on your local file system.

By default, `buf generate` looks for a
[`buf.gen.yaml`](/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml) in your current directory. An
alternate location can be specified by usin the `--template` flag:

```terminal
$ buf generate --template templates/buf.go.gen.yaml
```

You can also run `buf generate`. For example if all of your `.proto` files are
in directory `foo`:

```terminal
# generate using the module defined in the foo/ directory
$ buf generate foo
# generate using the files contained in the root directory
# of the github.com/acme/weather repository on the default branch
$ buf generate https://github.com/acme/weather.git
# generate using the buf.gen.yaml file at templates/buf.go.gen.yaml
# using the files in the buf.build/grpc/grpc module
$ buf generate --template templates/buf.go.gen.yaml buf.build/acme/petapis
```

If you used one of the example `buf.gen.yaml` files from above, you should end
up with this file structure:

import Tree from "./_tree.mdx";

<Tree/>

## 4 Common use cases

### 4.1 protoc-gen-go

[`protoc-gen-go`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go) generates
message and enum stubs for Golang. The BSR hosts this plugin at
[buf.build/protocolbuffers/go](https://buf.build/protocolbuffers/go).

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml" {3}
version: v1
plugins:
  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

### 4.2 protoc-gen-go + protoc-gen-validate

[`protoc-gen-validate`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protoc-gen-validate) is a
plugin that generates polyglot message validators. The BSR hosts this plugin
pre-enabled for Go code generation at
[buf.build/bufbuild/validate-go](https://buf.build/bufbuild/validate-go).

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml" {4,8}
version: v1
plugins:
  # The protoc-gen-go stubs are required for grpc-go
  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
  - plugin: buf.build/bufbuild/validate-go
    # Make sure to generate your protoc-gen-validate code to the same
    # directory as protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

### 4.3 grpc-go

[`protoc-gen-go-grpc`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/tree/master/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc)
generates Golang service stubs for gRPC. The BSR hosts this plugin at
[buf.build/grpc/go](https://buf.build/grpc/go). Note that we'd recommend
checking out connect-go instead of using grpc-go (see the next section).

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml" {4,8}
version: v1
plugins:
  # The protoc-gen-go stubs are required for grpc-go
  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
  - plugin: buf.build/grpc/go
    # Make sure to generate your grpc-go code to the same
    # directory as protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go-grpc
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

### 4.4 connect-go

[Connect-Go](https://connect.build/docs/go/getting-started)
is a slim library for building browser and
gRPC-compatible HTTP APIs. Handlers and clients support three protocols: gRPC,
gRPC-Web, and Connect's own protocol.

[`protoc-gen-connect-go`](https://github.com/bufbuild/connect-go) generates
Golang service stubs for Connect. The BSR hosts this plugin at
[buf.build/bufbuild/connect-go](https://buf.build/bufbuild/connect-go).

```yaml title=buf.gen.yaml {4,8}
version: v1
plugins:
  # The protoc-gen-go stubs are required for grpc-go
  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
  - plugin: buf.build/bufbuild/connect-go
    # Unlike grpc-go, connect stubs do not need to be generated to the
    # same directory, however you are free to do so
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-connect-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

### 4.5 connect-web

[Connect-Web](https://connect.build/docs/web/getting-started) is a simple
library to call remote procedures from a web browser. Unlike REST, you get a
type-safe client and never have to think about serialization again.

[`protoc-gen-connect-web`](https://github.com/bufbuild/connect-web) generates
client service stubs for TypeScript and JavaScript. It requires the
[`protoc-gen-es`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es) plugin to generate
message and service stubs. The code those two plugins generate requires the
runtime libraries
[`@bufbuild/connect-web`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/connect-web),
and [`@bufbuild/protobuf`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/protobuf).

The BSR hosts these plugins at
[buf.build/bufbuild/connect-web](https://buf.build/bufbuild/connect-web) and
[buf.build/bufbuild/es](https://buf.build/bufbuild/es).

```yaml title=buf.gen.yaml {3,5}
version: v1
plugins:
  - plugin: buf.build/bufbuild/es
    out: gen/es
  - plugin: buf.build/bufbuild/connect-web
    out: gen/es
```

### 4.6 connect-swift

[Connect-Swift](https://connect.build/docs/swift/getting-started)
is a small library that provides support for using generated,
type-safe, and idiomatic Swift APIs to communicate with your app's servers.
It can be used with both the gRPC-Web and Connect protocols.

[`protoc-gen-connect-swift`](https://github.com/bufbuild/connect-swift)
is responsible for generating Swift clients, and relies on the models generated
by [`protoc-gen-swift`](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf).
The BSR hosts both of these plugins at
[buf.build/bufbuild/connect-swift](https://buf.build/bufbuild/connect-swift)
and [buf.build/apple/swift](https://buf.build/apple/swift), respectively.

To get started with Connect-Swift, check out the
[demo tutorial](https://connect.build/docs/swift/getting-started).

```yaml title=buf.gen.yaml {3,6}
version: v1
plugins:
  - plugin: buf.build/apple/swift
    opt: Visibility=Public
    out: gen/swift
  - plugin: buf.build/bufbuild/connect-swift
    opt: Visibility=Public
    out: gen/swift
```

## Conclusion

Code generation with Protobuf can be a complex and challenging process, which becomes more difficult when scaling to
multiple developers. Remote plugins are the answer. Buf's remote plugins offer a streamlined approach, removing the
need for local management and maintenance.
