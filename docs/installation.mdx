### Install the Buf CLI

To install the CLI, you can either utilize an installation script or download and extract an archive file that
corresponds to the version of your operating system from the command line.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
groupId="var-selection"
defaultValue="homebrew"
values={[
{label: 'Homebrew', value: 'homebrew'},
{label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},

<TabItem value="homebrew">

You can install `buf` on macOS or Linux using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```terminal
$ brew install bufbuild/buf/buf
```

This installs:

- The binaries `buf`, `protoc-gen-buf-breaking`, `protoc-gen-buf-lint`.
- Bash completion for `buf`.
- Fish completion for `buf`.
- Zsh completion for `buf`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

`buf` is available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/buf):

```terminal
$ npm install @bufbuild/buf
```

This installs the binaries `buf`, `protoc-gen-buf-breaking`,
`protoc-gen-buf-lint` to be used within your project.

To execute `buf` from the command line, you can use `npx`:

```terminal
npx buf --version
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gitHub">

`buf` is released via the [bufbuild/buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf)
repository.

Two types of assets are available:

- The single `buf`, `protoc-gen-buf-breaking`, and `protoc-gen-buf-lint`
binaries.
- A tarball containing the binaries, bash completion, fish completion, and zsh
completion.

See [the Releases page](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/releases) for the
current release.

### Binary

The binary is all that is needed to get started.

To install just the `buf` binary to `/usr/local/bin` for version `1.14.0`:

```sh
# Substitute BIN for your bin directory.
# Substitute VERSION for the current released version.
BIN="/usr/local/bin" && \
VERSION="1.14.0" && \
curl -sSL \
"https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/releases/download/v${VERSION}/buf-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" \
-o "${BIN}/buf" && \
chmod +x "${BIN}/buf"
```

`/usr/local/bin` should be on your `$PATH`.

To uninstall from `/usr/local/bin`:

```sh
# Substitute BIN for your bin directory.
BIN="/usr/local/bin" && \
rm -f "${BIN}/buf"
```

### Tarball

To install the `buf`, `protoc-gen-buf-breaking`, and `protoc-gen-buf-lint`
binaries, bash completion, fish completion, and zsh completion to `/usr/local`
for version `1.14.0`:

```sh
# Substitute PREFIX for your install prefix.
# Substitute VERSION for the current released version.
PREFIX="/usr/local" && \
VERSION="1.14.0" && \
curl -sSL \
"https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/releases/download/v${VERSION}/buf-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m).tar.gz" | \
tar -xvzf - -C "${PREFIX}" --strip-components 1
```

The binaries are installed to `/usr/local/bin`, which should be on your `$PATH`.

To uninstall from `/usr/local`:

```sh
# Substitute PREFIX for your install prefix.
PREFIX="/usr/local" && \
rm -f \
"${PREFIX}/bin/buf" \
"${PREFIX}/bin/protoc-gen-buf-breaking" \
"${PREFIX}/bin/protoc-gen-buf-lint" \
"${PREFIX}/etc/bash_completion.d/buf" \
"${PREFIX}/etc/fish/vendor_completions.d/buf.fish"
"${PREFIX}/etc/zsh/site-functions/_buf"
```

### Verifying a release

Releases are signed using our [minisign](https://github.com/jedisct1/minisign)
public key:

```
RWQ/i9xseZwBVE7pEniCNjlNOeeyp4BQgdZDLQcAohxEAH5Uj5DEKjv6
```

The release assets can be verified using this command (assuming that `minisign`
is installed):

```sh
# Substitute VERSION for the current released version.
VERSION="1.14.0" && \
curl -OL https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/releases/download/v${VERSION}/sha256.txt && \
curl -OL https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/releases/download/v${VERSION}/sha256.txt.minisig && \
minisign -Vm sha256.txt -P RWQ/i9xseZwBVE7pEniCNjlNOeeyp4BQgdZDLQcAohxEAH5Uj5DEKjv6
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="source">

The binary can be installed from source if `go` is installed, however we
recommend using one of the release assets instead.

```sh
# Substitute GOBIN for your bin directory
# Leave unset to default to $GOPATH/bin
GO111MODULE=on GOBIN=/usr/local/bin go install \
github.com/bufbuild/buf/cmd/buf@v1.14.0
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker">

Buf ships a Docker image ([bufbuild/buf](https://hub.docker.com/r/bufbuild/buf))
that enables you to use `buf` as part of your Docker workflow.

For example, you can run `buf lint` with this command:

```terminal
$ docker run --volume "$(pwd):/workspace" --workdir /workspace bufbuild/buf lint
---
google/type/datetime.proto:17:1:Package name "google.type" should be suffixed with a correctly formed version,
such as "google.type.v1".
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

### Scoop

You can install the `buf` CLI using the [Scoop] installer for Windows:

```powershell
scoop install buf
```

To update Buf:

```powershell
scoop update buf
```
